# store

This project is a simple version of a generic store app which I have created using React Native + Typescript. It is consuming a [fake products API](https://fakestoreapi.com/) to test it. I also used Redux Toolkit to cart state management. To test it I used Jest + Testing Library React Native.

### Running on your machine:

- Clone to your machine: `git clone git@github.com:gabrielbarth/store.git`;
- Go to project directory `cd store`;
- Install the project dependencies `yarn install`;
- Run `npx react-native run-ios` or `npx react-native run-android` to open on emulator;
- Run `npx react-native start` if project doesn't initialize automatically;
- Run `yarn test` to check tests with jest.
